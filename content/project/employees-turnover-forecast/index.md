 Collecting data from internal HR system, Analyzing the data and building model with more than 12 variables including Gender, level, Bonus, allowance, Age, Tenure and so on by Power BI.
 

Our model indicating the top 3 key influence are Bonus, Performance and Basic salary and we use them to build up a new column called Risk and set it to different level to find out the high potential turnover group. Our prediction accuracy rate and precision rate are over 75%.
 

Given by the information from the model and diagram, we find out that the group with less Bonus between 1000-2000, basic salary between 6000-10000, technical and function position, age between 25-34, and married are more likely to quit. 


Wrote out conclusion and insight to my supervisor such as negotiate with a fair offer based on their performance, and expand recruitment on those high potential turnover position. Help the team make further important decision.
