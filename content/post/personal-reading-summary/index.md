## Overview

* **Competitive Strategy Intro** Michael Porter is one of the gurus of contemporary management. In his book Competitive Advantage, he transformed theory and practice of business strategy teachings around the world. The book is brilliant and incredibly simple, so reading is a must. In it, Porter analyzes the complexity of the new competitive landscape in its five main forces. Also, it introduces a simple model with three generic strategies (low cost, differentiation, and focus) that help leaders around the world design their strategic positioning. 📚 **[E-book link](https://www.amazon.com/Competitive-Strategy-Techniques-Industries-Competitors-ebook/dp/B001CB34J0)**
